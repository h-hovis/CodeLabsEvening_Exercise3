// Exercise 3

// Objective - Deepen understanding of DOM selection methods and dynamic interaction by handling multiple elements.

// Instructions:

// 1. Create a new HTML file named multiple_buttons.html. In this file, include at least three buttons with the class btn_onclick. Each button can have unique text like "Button 1", "Button 2", and so on. 

// 2. In the same HTML file, create a <script> section.

// 3. Inside the script element, use the querySelectorAll method to select all buttons with the class btn_onclick.

// 4. Use the forEach method to loop over each button in the node list.

// 5. For each button, add an onclick event that will change the document's background color when the button is clicked.

// 6. Instead of setting a static color like #a7f3d0, make the color dynamic.

// 7. For an added challenge, assign a different color to each button so that when clicked, they change the background color to a unique hue.

// 8. Test your code by opening multiple_buttons.html in a browser. Each button should change the background to a distinct color.
